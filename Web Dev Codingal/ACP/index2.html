        <h3><mark>This is my after class project on HTML elements</mark></h3>
<p><b>I love science class and maths class</b></p>
In science class we are learning about Chemistry which involves compounds such as CO<sub>2</sub>
<p><strong>In maths class, we are learning about algebra which involves formulas such as a<sup>2</sup>+2ab+b<sup>2</sup> = (a+b)<sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<del>I love painting</del>
I love drawing in my free time.
<small> I also love playing the violin</small>
My favourite quote is: 
<q>The only way to do great work is to love what you do</q>
- Steve Jobs
